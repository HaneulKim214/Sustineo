    "\"\"\"Employee business travel should be classified as **Scope 3** emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the GHG Protocol guidelines provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Scope 1 emissions** are direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. Examples include emissions from company-owned vehicles (like the fleet operations in your data) or stationary combustion at owned facilities.\n",
    "*   **Scope 2 emissions** are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heat, or cooling consumed by the company.\n",
    "*   **Scope 3 emissions** are all other indirect emissions that are a consequence of the company's activities but occur from sources *not owned or controlled* by the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided GHG Protocol context explicitly mentions: \"Service sector companies may want to report on emissions from employee business travel; this emissions source is not as likely to be...\" (implying it's a relevant Scope 3 category).\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee business travel typically involves activities such as air travel, hotel stays, or use of rental cars, which are services provided by third parties (airlines, hotels, car rental companies). The company does not own or directly control the aircraft, hotels, or rental vehicles used for these activities. Therefore, the emissions generated from these activities are indirect and fall under Scope 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Calculate Business Travel Emissions\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate your business travel emissions, you need to gather activity data related to employee travel and apply appropriate emission factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Calculation Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Collect Activity Data:** This involves tracking the distance traveled by mode of transport (e.g., air miles, train miles, car miles), the type of fuel consumed (if applicable for rental cars), or the number of nights spent in hotels.\n",
    "    *   For air travel: Distance flown (e.g., passenger-miles or tonne-miles) by flight class (economy, business, first) and route type (short-haul, long-haul).\n",
    "    *   For rail travel: Distance traveled by train type.\n",
    "    *   For road travel (rental cars, taxis): Distance traveled or fuel consumed.\n",
    "2.  **Apply Emission Factors:** Use relevant emission factors for each mode of transport. These factors convert activity data (e.g., miles, liters of fuel) into CO2e emissions. Emission factors are typically sourced from government agencies, industry bodies, or specialized databases (e.g., DEFRA, EPA, ICAO).\n",
    "    *   Example: (Total miles flown by employees) x (CO2e emission factor per mile for air travel) = Total air travel emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation from Your Provided Emissions Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your provided data already includes a breakdown of Scope 3 emissions by activity, specifically listing \"Business Travel - Air\" across various categories. To calculate your total business travel emissions from this data, you need to sum the `CO2e_Tonnes` for all entries with the `Activity_Description` of \"Business Travel - Air\".\n",
