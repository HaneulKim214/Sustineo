Question1: Should employee business travel be classified as Scope 1 or Scope 3? 
Explain the reasoning and describe how I can calculate my business travel emissions? 

Answer: 

Based on the GHG Protocol guidelines and the provided emissions data, employee business travel should be classified as **Scope 3**.

### Reasoning for Classification:

1.  **GHG Protocol Definition of Scope 3:** The GHG Protocol defines Scope 3 emissions as "a consequence of the activities of the company, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company." (Context 3).
2.  **Ownership and Control:** The key determinant for classifying emissions as Scope 1 or Scope 3 is whether the emission sources are "owned or controlled by the company." (Context 1).
    *   **Scope 1** emissions are direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company (e.g., company-owned vehicles, stationary combustion at company facilities).
    *   **Scope 3** emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, but from sources not owned or controlled by the company.
3.  **Employee Business Travel:** When employees travel for business, they typically use commercial airlines, rental cars, taxis, or their personal vehicles. In these scenarios, the company does not own or directly control the aircraft, rental car, or personal vehicle that is emitting the GHGs.
    *   Context 1 explicitly lists "Employee business travel" as an activity that, depending on the consolidation approach and ownership/control, can fall under Scope 3.
    *   The provided emissions data clearly categorizes "Business Travel - Air" and "Employee Commuting" under various "Category" headings within the **Scope 3** summary, reinforcing this classification for your company.

Therefore, since the emission sources for employee business travel (e.g., commercial flights, third-party ground transportation) are not owned or controlled by your company, these emissions are correctly classified as Scope 3.

### How to Calculate Business Travel Emissions:

The GHG Protocol states that "Scope 3 GHG emissions will primarily be calculated from activity data such as fuel use or passenger miles and published or third-party emission factors." (Context 2).

Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate your business travel emissions:

1.  **Identify Activity Data:**
    *   **For Air Travel:** Collect data on the distance traveled by employees (e.g., passenger-miles or passenger-kilometers). This data can often be obtained from travel booking systems, expense reports, or corporate travel agencies. For more accuracy, differentiate by flight distance (short-haul, long-haul) and class of travel (economy, business, first class), as these factors influence per-passenger emissions.
    *   **For Ground Travel (e.g., rental cars, taxis, personal vehicles reimbursed for business use):** Collect data on miles/kilometers driven or the amount of fuel consumed.
    *   **For Rail Travel:** Collect data on passenger-miles or passenger-kilometers traveled by train.

2.  **Choose Emission Factors:**
    *   Select appropriate, up-to-date emission factors for each mode of transport. These can be sourced from:
        *   **Government bodies:** Such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the US, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the UK, or the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for air travel.
        *   **Industry databases:** Reputable third-party databases specializing in GHG emission factors.
        *   **Supplier-specific data:** Some airlines or travel providers may offer specific emissions data for your bookings.

3.  **Apply the Calculation Formula:**
    The general formula is: **Activity Data × Emission Factor = CO2e Emissions**

    *   **Example for Air Travel:**
        *   (Total passenger-miles flown for business) × (Emission factor per passenger-mile for air travel) = CO2e from air travel.
    *   **Example for Rental Cars:**
        *   (Total miles driven in rental cars) × (Emission factor per mile for average rental car) = CO2e from rental cars.
    *   **Example for Reimbursed Personal Vehicle Use:**
        *   (Total liters of gasoline purchased for reimbursed travel) × (Emission factor per liter of gasoline) = CO2e from personal vehicle use.

### Your Company's Business Travel Emissions (Based on Provided Data):

From your Scope 3 emissions summary, we can calculate the total emissions for "Business Travel - Air" and "Employee Commuting" by summing the values across all categories:

**1. Total Business Travel - Air Emissions:**
*   Category 1: 3230.54 tCO2e
*   Category 10: 2245.73 tCO2e
*   Category 11: 1836.18 tCO2e
*   Category 12: 2446.51 tCO2e
*   Category 13: 4271.45 tCO2e
*   Category 14: 2866.76 tCO2e
*   Category 15: 1582.76 tCO2e
*   Category 2: 2632.44 tCO2e
*   Category 3: 4874.98 tCO2e
*   Category 4: 836.95 tCO2e
*   Category 5: 2748.65 tCO2e
*   Category 6: 4414.45 tCO2e
*   Category 7: 3395.58 tCO2e
*   Category 8: 2473.86 tCO2e
*   Category 9: 6455.23 tCO2e

**Total Business Travel - Air = 46,310.51 tCO2e**

**2. Total Employee Commuting Emissions:**
*   Category 1: 1329.96 tCO2e
*   Category 10: 3796.69 tCO2e
*   Category 11: 2568.36 tCO2e
*   Category 12: 3627.39 tCO2e
*   Category 13: 4060.21 tCO2e
*   Category 14: 3228.85 tCO2e
*   Category 15: 857.51 tCO2e
*   Category 2: 1773.04 tCO2e
*   Category 3: 1943.04 tCO2e
*   Category 4: 2906.97 tCO2e
*   Category 5: 865.80 tCO2e
*   Category 6: 2414.30 tCO2e
*   Category 7: 1451.07 tCO2e
*   Category 8: 1469.43 tCO2e
*   Category 9: 1363.85 tCO2e

**Total Employee Commuting = 33,656.47 tCO2e**

In summary, employee business travel (including air travel and other modes) and employee commuting are both classified as Scope 3 emissions because the company does not own or control the emission sources. You can calculate these emissions by gathering activity data (e.g., passenger-miles, fuel consumption) and applying relevant emission factors. Based on your provided data, your company's total "Business Travel - Air" emissions are **46,310.51 tCO2e**, and "Employee Commuting" emissions are **33,656.47 tCO2e**.

Some of these activities will be included under scope 1 if the pertinent emission sources are owned or controlled by the company (e.g., if the transportation of products is done in vehicles owned or controlled by the company). To determine if an activity falls within scope 1 or scope 3, the company should refer to the selected consolidation approach (equity or control) used in setting its organizational boundaries.

Even small users usually know both the amount of fuel consumed and have access to data on the carbon content of the fuel through default carbon content coefficients or through more accurate periodic fuel sampling. Companies should use the most accurate calculation approach available to them and that is appropriate for their reporting context. Collect activity data and choose emission factors For most small to medium-sized companies and for many larger companies, scope 1 GHG emissions will be calcu- lated based on the purchased quantities of commercial fuels (such as natural gas and heating oil) using published emission factors. Scope 2 GHG emissions will primarily be calculated from metered electricity consumption and supplier-specific, local grid, or other published emission factors. Scope 3 GHG emissions will primarily be calculated from activity data such as fuel use or passenger miles and published or third-party emission factors. In most cases, if source- or

Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. Some examples of scope 3 activities are extraction and production of purchased materials; transportation of purchased fuels; and use of sold products and services.
