Question2: Are my scope 2 emissions calculation valid according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol? 

Answer: 

As a sustainability regulator with expert knowledge of the GHG Protocol, I have reviewed your Scope 2 emissions data summary against the provided context and the broader GHG Protocol guidelines.

Here is my validation:

1.  **Validity and Alignment with the GHG Protocol:**
    The provided summary indicates several positive aspects regarding the integrity of your Scope 2 data:
    *   The presence of `CO2e_Tonnes` as the reported metric is appropriate for GHG emissions.
    *   The absence of negative values in `Emission_Factor`, `Consumption_Amount`, and `CO2e_Tonnes` columns suggests robust data quality and prevents erroneous calculations.
    *   The mention of a "Renewable percentage available with value: 13.61% so that we can compute market-based emissions" is a crucial point. The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (which expands upon the general definition provided in your context) mandates that companies report **both location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions**. Location-based emissions reflect the average emissions intensity of the grids where electricity consumption occurs, while market-based emissions reflect emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen (e.g., through renewable energy contracts, certificates, or supplier-specific data).

    **However, the summary does not explicitly state that both location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions have been calculated and reported.** While the availability of a renewable percentage indicates the *potential* to calculate market-based emissions, it does not confirm that this has been done and presented alongside location-based figures.

    Therefore, based on the information provided:
    *   The data appears to be **partially valid** in terms of its internal consistency and the availability of components for calculation.
    *   It is **not fully confirmed as aligned** with the comprehensive reporting requirements of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, as the dual reporting of both location-based and market-based emissions is not explicitly stated as completed. To be fully compliant, you must report both.

2.  **Latest Update Date of Relevant Regulations:**
    The primary regulation for Scope 2 emissions reporting, the **GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance**, was last updated and published in **January 2015**.

3.  **Next Expected Update Date of the Regulations:**
    The GHG Protocol is currently undergoing a **Standard Review Process** for its Corporate Standard and Scope 2 Guidance. A public consultation on proposed revisions was anticipated in late 2023 / early 2024. Based on this timeline, **final updates to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance are expected in 2024 or 2025.** 

    
Context used: 

1. companys performance over time. Reductions in indirect emissions Reductions in indirect emissions (changes in scope 2 or 3 emissions over time) may not always capture the actual emissions reduction accurately. This is because there is not always a direct cause-effect relationship between the activity of the reporting company and the resulting GHG emissions. For example, a reduction in air travel would reduce a companys scope 3 emissions. This reduction is usually quantified based on an average emission factor of fuel use per passenger. However, how this reduction actually translates into a change in GHG emissions to the atmosphere would depend on a number of factors, including whether another person takes the empty seat or whether this unused seat contributes to reduced air traffic over the longer term. Similarly, reductions in scope 2 emissions calculated with an average grid emissions factor may over- or underestimate the actual reduction depending on the nature of the grid. 

2. in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.; emissions from chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment. Direct CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass shall not be included in scope 1 but reported separately (see chapter 9). GHG emissions not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, e.g. CFCs, NOx, etc. shall not be included in scope 1 but may be reported separately (see chapter 9). Scope 2: Electricity indirect GHG emissions Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from the genera- tion of purchased electricity2 consumed by the company. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is purchased or otherwise brought into the organizational boundary of the company. Scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where electricity is generated. Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions Scope 3 is an optional reporting category that allows for the treatment of all other indirect emissions. Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company, but
